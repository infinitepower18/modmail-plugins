# Announcement channel publish plugin
This plugin can be used to publish messages posted in announcement channels. This was created at a time when Discord mobile didn't have the Publish option.

## Installation
You can install the plugin on your [ModMail bot](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail) by typing `[p]plugin install infinitepower18/modmail-plugins/publish@master`.

## Usage
Make sure the message posted is in a channel marked as an [announcement channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192-Announcement-Channels-). Copy the message ID of the message you want to publish ([refer here if you don't know how](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)) and type `[p]publish <paste message ID here without the brackets>`. You should get a confirmation message afterwards.

By default, you need permission level 3 (Moderator) to use this plugin.
